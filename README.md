## API

The images are named according to this pattern: **sax.png**, where:
- **s** is the sex, among **f** for female and **m** for male.
- **a** is the age, among **y** for younger, **o** for older and **m** for middle age.
- **x** is a number representing satisfaction level (the smile), **0** is the lowest level and **2** the highest.

For example, **fy2.png** is for a young girl with a large smile. See here: https://jgaffuri.github.io/chernoff-faces/out/v1/fy2.png
